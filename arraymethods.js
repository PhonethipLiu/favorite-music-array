// Use JavaScript arrays and innerHTML to show the music you love.

// * Create and modify arrays with join, push, reverse, sort, concat and unshift.
// * Output lists to the DOM.
// *Create three separate arrays; one for **songs**, one for **albums**, and one for **artists**.

const songs = [], // *The song array should be initialized with 10 songs.
     albums = [], // *Each subsequent array should hold the corresponding data (artist and album).
    artists = [];

// * Using a form; Add 2 more songs.
//     + Each song should be added to the end of the song array.
//     + Each artist should be added to the beginning of the artist array.
//     + Each album should be added to the end of the album array.

// * For each output element arrange the corresponding data as follows:
//     *   Output vertically descending alphabetically.
//     *   Output vertically ascending alphabetically.
//     *   Output vertically exactly as the data was added.
//     *   Output vertically exactly as the data was added, inverted.
//     *   Output horizontally descending alphabetically, separated by `, `.
//     *   Output horizontally ascending alphabetically, separated by ` >> `.
//     *   Output horizontally exactly as the data was added, separated by ` : `.
//     *   Output horizontally exactly as the data was added, inverted, separated by ` | `.
// * Each output area should be separated by a headline tag.
